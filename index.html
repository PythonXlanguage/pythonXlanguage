    <h1>our website may be lame, but we love python, and most people should</h1>
    <h2>it is a scripting language, and thats not bad, you can do whatever you want</h2>
    <h2>and most companies love it for its libraries</h2>
    <h2>While libraries are great, if you dont use them, it might take hundreds or even thousands of lines of code to do the same thing</h2>
    <h2>and if you want to create games, it is impossible to do that without a library like pygame or pyglet<h2>
    <h2>so we decided to start working on a project th at had the same easyness to learn as python, but you had more power</h2>
    <h2>so yes, while this page may suck, it exists to tell you about the language, thats it, i will not provide a download link until im finished coding the language</h2>
